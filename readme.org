* dotfiles
My config files for various programs that I use often. 
** requirements
 - emacs 27.1 installed with modules
 - zsh 5.8
 - tmux 3.0a
 - git, coreutils, moreutils, xclip, ranger, vim, gotop, yakuake
** installation
provide a =.env= file with hidden environment variables, like =.env.example=, and run the =deploy.sh= script.

Initial emacs setup will install all packages, but require permission for the installation of vterm and epdf. Also run =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts= to install the icons for the modeline. 
*** on windows 
Make sure it's run under normal user. Emacs requires the server
directory to be owned by the user, fix manually by opening the
properties of =$DOTFILES_DIR/.emacs.d/server= > Security > Advanced > Owner. Here change to your own login name.
